<blockquote>
This page contains a list of all remaining tasks for the semester.

**Deadlines are all 11:59PM D.C. time on the specified date**.  For some assignments we have two deadlines:
  - *Suggested deadline:* Meet this to ensure you are keeping up with topics as we cover them. If you submit by this date you will get a **+5 bonus** to your assignment grade.
  - *Final deadline:* This is the latest date you can submit without penalty. After this point you will lose 5 points per day late.

  You are strongly encouraged to keep to the suggested deadlines since undoubtedly you will get busier with other classes the closer you get to the end of the semester.
