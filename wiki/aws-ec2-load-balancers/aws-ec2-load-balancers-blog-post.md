If you were to count the number of seconds that passes between each wave, you'd be measuring the frequency of each wave. So, if 1 second were to pass between two waves, the wave frequency would be 1 Hz, or one cycle per second. In order to receive any information that is being send between these waves, the receiver needs to be set on a frequency that can read this incoming information at the correct rate.
