Lucas taught Tim Go... and we recorded it so you can learn too! These are not polished videos, but they will help you set up a Go environment and write basic code.

We encourage you to use a consistent environment: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as your IDE and the basic Go command line tools for compilation.

## Setting Up Go and Visual Studio Code

> **Preqreq:** This video assumes you have already installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Notes:
  1. First, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Then, to install Go, [go here](https://golang.org/dl/) and get the version for your OS. You may need to re-open any terminals you have active after installing to ensure the go executables are in your path.

## Go Language Basics
Watch as Lucas walks Tim through some Go language basics!

Here is the code we wrote during the tutorial in case you want to try it out:
