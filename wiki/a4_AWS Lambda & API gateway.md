*by:* Henian Wang

In this project, I will use AWS lambda function with an Amazon API gateway. By combining the two AWS services, applications can built in "serverless" deployment.

"Serverless" architecture is an important area of cloud computing, and is getting more attention from the industry. The idea behind 'serverless' is that users don't manage provisioning, scaling, or maintenance of the physical machines that host their application code. AWS services, as a pioneer in "Serverless" area, provide relative services for users: AWS lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS Batch, and AWS DynamoDB. In this article, a simple instance that combined AWS lambda with AWS API gateway will be introduced as a startup of "serverless" architecture. In this case, an API that route HTTP requests to a lambda function will be created by using AWS services.


## 1. Create a AWS lambda function

AWS lambda is AWS' serverless compute offering as a part of AWS services. It allows users to define Lambda functions in a selection of runtimes that can be invoked via a variety of triggers, including SNS notifications and API Gateway invocations. AWS


AWS lambda provides three types of functions to create: Author from scratch, blue print, and Browse serverless app repository. Using a blue print to create a Lambda application is useful and convinient for common uses, or you can build a Lambda application from scratch, which needs writing codes and configuration written by yourself.

## 2. Test the function

## 3. Create an API by Amazon API gateway


## 4. Set Lambda function as the destination for POST method


## 5. Test


## What did he find on the Apple System?



## What did he find on the Windows System?
